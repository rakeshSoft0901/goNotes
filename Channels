1️⃣ What is a Channel?
A channel is a typed conduit used to send and receive data between goroutines.

ch := make(chan int)
📌 Used for safe communication, not shared memory.

2️⃣ Why Channels?
✔ Synchronization
✔ Communication
✔ Avoid race conditions
✔ Follow Go proverb
“Do not communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating”

3️⃣ Channel Direction
ch <- 10      // send
x := <-ch     // receive

4️⃣ Blocking Behavior (VERY IMPORTANT)
Send blocks until receive
Receive blocks until send
📌 This is synchronization.

5️⃣ Unbuffered Channel
ch := make(chan int)

✔ Send & receive must meet
✔ Strong synchronization

6️⃣ Buffered Channel

ch := make(chan int, 3)
✔ Send blocks only when buffer full
✔ Receive blocks when empty

7️⃣ Channel Capacity & Length
cap(ch) // buffer size
len(ch) // current items

8️⃣ Channel with Goroutines

go func() {
    ch <- 10
}()

fmt.Println(<-ch)

9️⃣ Channel Deadlock (INTERVIEW FAVORITE)

ch := make(chan int)
ch <- 10 // ❌ deadlock
📌 No receiver → program crashes.

🔟 Closing Channels
close(ch)
✔ Sender should close
❌ Receiver should NOT close

1️⃣1️⃣ Receiving from Closed Channel
v, ok := <-ch
ok == false → channel closed
v → zero value

1️⃣2️⃣ Range Over Channel
for v := range ch {
    fmt.Println(v)
}
✔ Stops when channel is closed.

1️⃣3️⃣ Sending on Closed Channel (PANIC)
close(ch)
ch <- 10 // ❌ panic

1️⃣4️⃣ Nil Channel Behavior (TRICKY)

var ch chan int

Send blocks forever
Receive blocks forever
Used in select patterns

1️⃣5️⃣ Directional Channels (INTERVIEW)
func send(ch chan<- int) {}
func receive(ch <-chan int) {}
✔ Improves safety
✔ Documents intent

1️⃣6️⃣ Select Statement (PREVIEW)
select {
case v := <-ch:
    fmt.Println(v)
default:
    fmt.Println("No data")
}

✔ Non-blocking communication.

1️⃣7️⃣ Channel as Signal
done := make(chan struct{})

go func() {
    close(done)
}()
<-done
✔ Zero-memory signal.

1️⃣8️⃣ Fan-out / Fan-in Pattern

One channel → many workers
Many workers → one channel
✔ Very common interview topic.

1️⃣9️⃣ Channel vs Mutex (RECAP)
Channel	                        Mutex
Communication	                  Shared memory
Safer logic	                    Faster
Data flow	                      Critical section

2️⃣0️⃣ Common Interview Traps

❌ Deadlock due to missing receiver
❌ Closing channel twice
❌ Sending on closed channel
❌ Forgetting buffer size

Channel
A channel is a typed conduit used to safely communicate between goroutines.

Buffered vs Unbuffered
Unbuffered channels synchronize goroutines, buffered channels decouple them.

🧠 Quick Memory Points
Send blocks
Receive blocks
Close by sender
Range until closed
Nil blocks forever

21️⃣ Happens-Before Guarantee (VERY IMPORTANT)
ch <- x
y := <-ch
✔ Write to x happens before receive
✔ Channels provide memory visibility

👉 Mutex & channels both create happens-before relation
