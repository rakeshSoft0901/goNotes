Que 1. What is a Variable?
Ans 1. A variable is a named memory location used to store a value.
Go is a statically typed language: Type is known at compile time, not runtime.

Variable Declaration Methods: Package-level variables
1. var keyword (explicit type)
var age int
age = 25

var age int = 25

2. Type inference with var : Compiler infers type → string
var age = 25

3. Short declaration := (MOST USED)
age := 25
Rules: 
  1. Only inside functions
  2. Cannot be used at package level
  3. Must declare at least one new variable

Invalid: 
    age := 30 // if age already exists in same scope
Valid:
    age, salary := 30, 50000

4. Multiple Variable Declaration
    var a, b, c int = 1, 2, 3
    x, y := 10, "hello"

5. Block Declaration (Recommended):  Clean & production-friendly 
    var (
    name string = "Go"
    age  int    = 10
    isGo bool   = true
)

## Zero Values (🔥 VERY IMPORTANT)
    If you declare a variable but don’t initialize it, Go assigns a zero value.
    | Type    | Zero Value        |
    |-------- |------------------ |
    | int     | `0`               |
    | float  | `0.0`             |
    | bool   | `false`           |
    | string | `""` (empty)      |
    | pointer| `nil`             |
    | slice  | `nil`             |
    | map    | `nil`             |
    | struct | fields zeroed     |
    var x int
    fmt.Println(x) // 0

-Does Go have uninitialized variables?
-No. Every variable has a default zero value.
    
Que 2. Why := is not allowed outside function?
Ans 2. Because it requires runtime context; package-level variables must be resolved at compile time.

# Data Types in Go
  ## Basic Data Types
  - Integers
  int, int8, int16, int32, int64
  uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64

  int size depends on architecture:
    32-bit system → 4 bytes
    64-bit system → 8 bytes

  - Why use int64 instead of int?
  - For portability & large values (DB IDs, timestamps)

  - Floating Point
    float32, float64
  Default float type = float64
  x := 3.14 // float64

  - Boolean
    var isActive bool = true
    Go does not allow:
    if 1 { } // ❌ invalid

    Must be boolean:
      if isActive { }
  
  - Strings
      var name string = "GoLang"
      Strings are immutable:
        name[0] = 'G' // ❌ compile error
      Use []byte or []rune to modify

Que 3. Difference between var and :=
Ans 3. var is used for explicit or package-level variable declarations and supports zero values,
  while := is a shorthand declaration used inside functions that requires initialization and at least one new variable.

  -  Scope Rules
    var → Works everywhere
    ```package main

      var x = 10 // ✅ allowed
      
      func main() {
          var y = 20
      }```

    := → Function scope only
    x := 10 // ❌ compile-time error
    Reason - Package-level variables must be resolved at compile time.

  - Zero Value Behavior
    var x int
    fmt.Println(x) // 0

    x := 0 // must initialize
    := cannot declare variable without value.

  - Redeclaration Rules (VERY IMPORTANT)
     - Invalid:
        x := 10
        x := 20
     - Valid (at least one new variable)
        x := 10
        x, y := 20, 30 // Left side must contain at least one new variable.
  
  - Variable Shadowing (TRICKY)
    ```x := 10
      if true {
          x := 20
      }
      fmt.Println(x) // 10
  ```
        Inner x shadows outer x.
        Avoid shadowing in production code

  - Type Declaration
        var a int = 10



- What is a Constant?
- A constant is a value that cannot be changed after it is declared.
const a = 10
const name = "Go"

Key Rules of Constants
  1. Value cannot change
  2. Must be known at compile time
  3. Can be declared inside or outside functions
  4. Type is optional

- Multiple Constant Declaration
  const (
      a = 1
      b = 2
      c = 3
  )

- Constants with Expressions
const x = 10
const y = x + 5
Allowed because values are known at compile time.

- iota (Simple Explanation)
  iota is used to create auto-incrementing constants.

const (
    A = iota // 0
    B        // 1
    C        // 2
)


-> What Constants CANNOT Do
  - Cannot use runtime values
  const x = time.Now() // ❌ error

  - Cannot be declared using :=
  const a := 10 // ❌ invalid

=><=  Constants in Go are immutable values declared using const, evaluated at compile time, and can be typed or untyped.
